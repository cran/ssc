\method{predict}{selfTraining}(object, x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{SelfTraining model built with \code{\link{selfTraining}} function.}

Depending on how was the model built, \code{x} is interpreted as a matrix
with the distances between the unseen instances and the selected training instances,
or a matrix of instances.}

\item{...}{Additional objects that can be coerced as matrix.

This objects are interpreted as matrices of distances between the unseen instances
and the selected training instances.}
}
